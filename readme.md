# LaravelHelpers [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/EscapeWork/LaravelHelpers.png)](http://travis-ci.org/EscapeWork/LaravelHelpers) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/escapework/laravelhelpers/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/escapework/laravelhelpers) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/escapework/laravelhelpers/downloads.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/escapework/laravelhelpers)

A set of tools and helpers to help the [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com) development.

### Instalation

Install via [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/escapework/laravelhelpers).

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "escapework/laravelhelpers": "0.7.*"
    }
}
```

### Models

To make use of the best things in LaravelHelpers, please make sure all your models extends the `BaseModel` class.

```php
use EscapeWork\LaravelHelpers\BaseModel;

class Product extends BaseModel
{

    // ...
}
```

### Slugs

If you need to make an slug for your model, just use the `SluggableTrait`;

```php
use EscapeWork\LaravelHelpers\BaseModel;
use EscapeWork\LaravelHelpers\SluggableTrait;

class Product extends BaseModel
{

    use SluggableTrait;
}
```

When executing the `save` and `update` method, the slug is going to be automatically generated by the helper.

The default slug is made by the attribute `title`. But if you have a diferent attribute, just declare the `$sluggableAttr` with the field name.

```php
protected $sluggableAttr = 'name';
```

If you don't want the slug to change when updating your model, set the `$makeSlugOnUpdate` attribute on your model.

```php
    protected $makeSlugOnUpdate = false;
```

And the, just use in the regular way your model:

```php
    public function store()
    {
        $this->product->title = 'Hello World';
        $this->product->save();

        echo $this->product->slug; // prints hello-world
    }
}
```

### Combobox

LaravelHelpers have a method for make combobox easier when using with the `Form` class.

```php
Form::select('product_id', Product::all()->combobox());
```

The default attribute for the option text is the `title` attribute. In case you need other field, just use like this:

```php
Form::select('client_id', Client::all()->combobox(['field' => 'name']); // for using the 'name' field
```

If you want to create an 'empty' option, you can use like this:

```php
Form::select('client_id', Client::all()->combobox(['field' => 'name', 'empty_option' => true, 'empty_option_label' => 'Select a client']));
```

***

The documentation below this line is for the version `0.6`, so not everything is the same for now.

### Find or Fail By

```php
$product = App::make('ProductRepository'); // just a sample, you probably will use dependency injection
$product->findOrFailBy('slug', 'office-chair');

dd($product->title);
```

If the product was not found, then a `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ModelNotFoundException` will be thrown, like the Eloquent function `findOrFail`.
